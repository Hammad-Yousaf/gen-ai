"That was a huge deal," Cosby added. "You know, that was an enormous deal."

But in the years since, Cosby's reputation has been restored in Hollywood, thanks to the efforts of the late actress and comedian Gwyneth Paltrow and the late actor Mark Ruffalo. The pair are behind the film, which is slated to hit theaters in the coming weeks.

Paltrow, who died on Dec. 16, is also currently making an appearance in the movie. And in December, Ruffalo was spotted in the movie's premiere, where he was seen kissing and touching a young boy at a bar.

It's not the first time Cosby has appeared in a movie. In 2007, the actor was seen in

The Movie of the Week: "The Good Place" (Netflix)

Rating: 4.2/5

The Good Place is a fun, funny show about a family of kids who discover they're the luckiest people on the planet when they decide to build a home together. The story is set on the fictional town of Good Place, which is the hometown of the lead characters, but it's also the setting for the show's other main characters — it's the one place that they can actually start making a life together, and the ones who can do it will become the best people on Earth.

The Good Place is also the first show to explore how the show's cast of characters is affected by the fact that they're not together. I've been very surprised by how many actors I've met who aren't on the show. The show has been around for so long, and it

I'd be a better man to pick that player off my list than to have to choose a random name. He's a great person. He's very bright. He's a great coach and he's a great person. He's a good guy and I'm very lucky to have him.

So do you think he'll have the same impact on the club in the future?

Well I think so. You've got to remember the last time he was involved with us it was a very short period of time. He played for us for two years, for one game, in the first ODI. It's not like he was involved for five or 10 years. He came in and we played a couple of games, one in Sydney and one in Adelaide. I think we played two Tests there. He played one match and then he left for England.

But what about the other players who are better than him? Well, we don't really know who is better. In the last Test against Australia, Sri Lanka played some excellent bowling but they also lost by two wickets, so it is not like they played all their wickets with a perfect ball. In fact, they lost all their wickets by a single run. There are players who have made it to the top of the list of all-time great batsmen but they also made it to the top of the list of all-time great players.
