I used to cover the war in Ukraine for the international desk. My tastes are a mix of mope-rock, video games that don’t stress me out and movies that you wake up thinking about. Here are five things I’ve watched, read or played recently →@2023 TOHO CO., LTD., via Associated PressMovie: ‘Godzilla Minus One’I’m not a monster-movie guy, but anything that looks at postwar Japan, especially through the filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki’s eyes, feels important. I was not disappointed. Godzilla was a great foil for an enduring trial of war: how to come home. And of course one of the last lines was among the best: “Is your war finally over?”Song: ‘Blood Type’This 1988 song by the Soviet band Kino is about a soldier in Afghanistan who, in so many words, is asking not to die in some faraway place. It hits harder now as I reflect on my time in Afghanistan, especially as a Marine. It’s a reminder that these similar feelings of futility in war are enduring.Video Game: ‘Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater’I borrowed my friend’s PlayStation when this first came out, though the game is (thankfully) now on Nintendo Switch. When I was in Ukraine in May, before a serious interview that ended up in a McDonald’s (that’s a whole other story), I booted up the first chapter. “Commencing Virtuous Mission,” Snake drawled, and I was hooked once more.Book: ‘Nothing Good Happens in Wazirabad on Wednesday’After my colleague and one of the best storytellers I know, Mujib Mashal, posted a photo of this book on Instagram, I knew I was going to read it. The novel, by Jamaluddin Aram, takes place in Afghanistan in the early 1990s. It provides an intimate look at a confusing time that still echoes today across the country.Video Game: ‘Animal Well’After Hollow Knight and its overwhelming map and multiple endings sank almost a year of my life, my quest for another Metroidvania of similar size and scope remained unfinished (though the Ori games were close). But I think Animal Well, with its sparse story, delightful graphics and many hidden puzzles, is on its way to closing that gap.Here are some more favorites:What’s in Our Queue? ‘Dear Ex’ and MoreWhat’s in Our Queue? ‘BoJack Horseman’ and More1 of 71 of 7Item 1 of 71 of 71 of 7 The MorningNewsletterA Playlist to RememberSongs can help demarcate the chapters of your life and keep one period of time from bleeding indistinctly into the next, Melissa Kirsch writes.7 min readIn Case You Missed ItAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMore NewsWhistle-Blower Groups Push to End Secret Seizure of Congressional CommunicationsDuring the Trump administration, the Justice Department subpoenaed congressional aides’ communications without their knowledge.
